In the 2024-25 season of the UEFA champions league, a new league format was introduced to accomodate for the increase from 32 to 36 teams participating in the competition.

Details of the draw are as follows:

> All 36 teams will be manually drawn using physical balls. For every team manually drawn, a designated automated software will randomly draw eight opponents across the four pots, who will be revealed on screen in the draw hall and on television. The software will also decide which matches will be at home and which ones away.<sup>[[1]](https://www.uefa.com/news-media/news/028f-1b7f80216368-4c26e95cc15b-1000/)</sup>

This repo implements the 'designated automated software' mentioned above. 

# Rules
The following rules determine which opponents are compatible:

>To determine the eight different opponents, teams will be seeded in four pots ... Each team will then be drawn against two opponents from each pot, one of which will be at home and one away.
>In the league phase teams cannot face opponents from their country and can be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same country.<sup>[[1]](https://www.uefa.com/news-media/news/028f-1b7f80216368-4c26e95cc15b-1000/)</sup>
